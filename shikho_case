Affiliate/Franchise Course Link Not Generating Properly for SSC Animated Course
As a franchise/affiliate marketer of Shikho, when I try to share the coupon/discount link for the SSC Animated Course, the system redirects me directly to the checkout page instead of generating a shareable affiliate link.

Steps to Reproduce:

Log in as an affiliate/franchise user.

Navigate to the SSC Animated Course page.

Click on the “Share/Copy Link” option.

Instead of copying the link, the page redirects to the checkout process.

Actual Behavior:
The system skips link generation and sends the user directly to checkout.

Expected Behavior:
Clicking on “Share/Copy Link” should generate an affiliate link (with coupon/discount included) that can be shared with followers.

Impact:

Affiliate marketers cannot properly promote the SSC Animated Course.

Loss of potential marketing exposure and sales conversion.
